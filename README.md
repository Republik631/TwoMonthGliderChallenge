# TwoMonthGliderChallenge
Team 13's repository of glider stuff.

The two zipped folders are necessary libraries. Download them, extract them, and put them in Documents > Arduino > Libraries.
Restart the Arduino program and they should be installed. You can verify this by checking at the bottom of the list of examples (File > Examples). The libraries are linked below, but may not be the newest versions.
 
[BMP388 Library](Adafruit_BMP3XX_Library.zip)

[ICM-20948 Library](SparkFun_9DoF_IMU_Breakout_-_ICM_20948_-_Arduino_Library.zip)
  
gliderChallenge.ino is the main program. It should be put in a Documents > Arduino > gliderChallenge , and can then be opened. As of now it compiles without errors, so this is  good way to verify tht the code has no logic errors.
